      could never be washed clean / and that woman / he didn’t want to bathe with that woman / so I put on clothes / gave him a hug. “don’t,” I warned him, “tell her / or she’ll get dirtier still.” / he disappeared in my arms / I thought he must have
      woken / I didn’t want to bathe anymore / it’s just a dream / the really normal kind / wet / dirty / a dream with a man
